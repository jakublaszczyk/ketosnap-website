            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how KetoSnap ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

            <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
            <p><strong>Photos:</strong> When you use the photo analysis feature, your food photos are sent to Google's Gemini AI service for nutritional analysis. Photos are processed in real-time and are not stored on our servers.</p>
            <p><strong>Food Logs:</strong> Your food entries, macro tracking data, and daily logs are stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
            <p><strong>Profile Information:</strong> Your keto profile settings (carb limits, goals) are stored locally on your device.</p>
            <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous analytics data to improve the app experience, such as feature usage patterns and crash reports.</p>

            <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide AI-powered food analysis and nutritional information</li>
                <li>To track and display your daily macro progress</li>
                <li>To personalize your keto experience based on your profile settings</li>
                <li>To improve our app and fix bugs</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>KetoSnap uses the following third-party services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Gemini AI:</strong> For food photo analysis. Photos are processed according to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For subscription management. RevenueCat processes payment information according to their <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Apple:</strong> For in-app purchases and App Store services, subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Storage & Security</h3>
            <p>Your food logs and profile data are stored locally on your device and may be backed up through iCloud if you have iCloud backup enabled. We do not have access to your iCloud backups.</p>
            <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

            <h3>Data Retention</h3>
            <p>Your local data remains on your device until you delete the app or clear the app's data. Photos sent for AI analysis are processed in real-time and are not retained by us.</p>

            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> View all your data within the app</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Delete your data by removing food entries or uninstalling the app</li>
                <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> You can use manual entry instead of photo analysis if you prefer not to use AI features</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>KetoSnap is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
